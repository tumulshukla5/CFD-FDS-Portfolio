# CFD & Fire Dynamics Simulation Portfolio

This repository presents my hands-on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
and Fire Dynamics Simulation (FDS) projects developed using ANSYS Fluent, 
ANSYS CFX, PyroSim, and Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).

## 🔥 Fire & Smoke Simulation Projects (FDS)

### 1. High-Rise Mechanical Floor – Fire & Smoke Simulation
- Fire growth modeling using HRR ramp (1 MW)
- Jet fan ventilation: normal (6 ACH) and fire mode (10 ACH)
- Smoke detector-based control logic
- Analysis of temperature, velocity, smoke layer height, and visibility

### 2. Retail Hypermarket Fire Simulation
- Large open-plan fire scenario
- Smoke propagation and extraction analysis
- Visibility-based tenability assessment

### 3. Commercial Kitchen / Food Lab – Heat Removal Ventilation
- Stove burner fire modeling
- Hood exhaust and make-up air system
- Capture efficiency, plume behavior, and tracer analysis

## 🌊 CFD Projects (ANSYS Fluent / CFX)
- Internal and external flow simulations
- Heat transfer and combustion fundamentals
- Mesh generation and post-processing using CFD-Post

## 🛠 Tools & Software
- Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), PyroSim, Smokeview
- ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS CFX, CFD-Post
- ANSYS SpaceClaim, ANSYS Meshing

## 👤 About Me
I am a CFD and Fire Simulation engineer transitioning into simulation-focused roles, 
with formal training from IIT Kharagpur (NPTEL) and hands-on project experience in 
fire, smoke, ventilation, and heat transfer analysis.
